Hello, I'm Jonas. I conduct research in computer science as PhD student at the University of Siegen. My background is in Mathematics, more specifically in mathematical optimization and I am interested in research that intersects current deep learning and mathematical optimization in general, but also in the implications of optimization in machine learning for the design of secure and private ML systems.

This webpage is likely not entirely up to date. Google/Semantic scholar and arxiv will have the latest updates.
