abstract: Three-dimensional time series data from confocal fluorescence microscopes
  is a valuable tool in biological research, but the data is distorted by Poisson
  noise and defocus blur of varying axial extent. We seek to obtain structural information
  about the develop- ment of neural tissue from these images and define a segmentation
  by an appropriate thresholding of reconstructed data. We model the data degradation
  and develop a reconstruction formulation based on variational methods. Due to imprecise
  knowledge of the blur kernel we extend local sparsity regularization to a local
  patch and use this prior as additional regularization. We show favorable analytical
  properties for this approach, implement the resulting algorithm with a primal-dual
  optimization scheme and test on artificial and real data.
