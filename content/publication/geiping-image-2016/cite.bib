 abstract = {Three-dimensional time series data from confocal fluorescence microscopes is a valuable tool in biological research, but the data is distorted by Poisson noise and defocus blur of varying axial extent. We seek to obtain structural information about the develop- ment of neural tissue from these images and define a segmentation by an appropriate thresholding of reconstructed data. We model the data degradation and develop a reconstruction formulation based on variational methods. Due to imprecise knowledge of the blur kernel we extend local sparsity regularization to a local patch and use this prior as additional regularization. We show favorable analytical properties for this approach, implement the resulting algorithm with a primal-dual optimization scheme and test on artificial and real data.},
