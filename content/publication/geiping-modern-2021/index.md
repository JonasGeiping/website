abstract: This thesis presents research into multiple optimization topics in computer
  vision with a conceptual focus on composite optimization problems such as bilevel
  optimization. The optimal graph-based discretization of variational problems in
  minimal partitions, the theoretical analysis of nonconvex composite optimization
  by nonconvex majorizers, the bilevel problem of learning energy models by nonconvex
  majorizers, and the machine learning security applications of bilevel optimization
  in privacy analysis of federated learning and dataset poisoning of general image
  classification are featured in this cumulative work.
