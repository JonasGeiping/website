abstract: 'We empirically evaluate common assumptions about neural networks that are
  widely held by practitioners and theorists alike. In this work, we: (1) prove the
  widespread existence of suboptimal local minima in the loss landscape of neural
  networks, and we use our theory to find examples; (2) show that small-norm parameters
  are not optimal for generalization; (3) demonstrate that ResNets do not conform
  to wide-network theories, such as the neural tangent kernel, and that the interaction
  between skip connections and batch normalization plays a role; (4) find that rank
  does not correlate with generalization or robustness in a practical setting.'
